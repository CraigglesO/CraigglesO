I have a mission to help push GIS into the next Era.

I'm actively working on [Open S2](https://github.com/Open-S2) - Modern tools built using the latest technology available. Create your next geo service using the most advanced digital software in the world. If this project interests you, or you want to connect with me about GIS, feel free to join my [Discord](https://discord.opens2.com).

```
Longing seizes people more powerfully than poison and more deeply than illness.
Once it catches hold of you, there is absolutely no escape. This is quite a 'curse',
and yet the adventurers all willingly devote themselves to its pursuit.
For them, a life without longing is more terrifying than death itself.
```
